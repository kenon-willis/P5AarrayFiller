P5A. 2D Array Filler

 

Create a 3x5 2D array of integers and fill it with numbers 1-15 in row-major (left to right, top to bottom) order using a nested for loop. Print the 2D array in “rectangular” format using nested foreach loops. 

Hint:


for(???? row: grid){
            for(int num: ???){
                
            }
            
        }




Then complete the following computations, using any type of nested loop you choose:

a.                 Calculate and print the sum total of all 15 elements of the array.

b.                 Calculate and print the sum total of each row in the array.

c.                  Calculate and print the sum total of each column in the array.

Be sure to preface each printout with a clear statement of what quantity is being printed.

d.  Make another array of the same size and same values but fill the array in column-major order.  Then print the array in rectangular format.




1  2  3  4  5 

6  7  8  9 10 

11 12 13 14 15 

Row 0 has a sum of 15

Row 1 has a sum of 40

Row 2 has a sum of 65

-----------------------

Col 0 has a sum of 18

Col 1 has a sum of 21

Col 2 has a sum of 24

Col 3 has a sum of 27

Col 4 has a sum of 30

-----------------------

The total sum of the 2Darray is 120

 

Now filling another 2Darray in column-major order
